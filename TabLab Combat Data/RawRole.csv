Assassin	A killer-for-hire who lurks in the shadows, then strikes with concealed weapons drawn in an instant.	Assassination	At low Zone Tension you can avoid combat, and the first time Zone Tension goes high enough you enter a Power Burst.
Brawler	A disciplined fighter who trains in both hand-to-hand combat and with various weapons.	Martial Arts	You deal more damage to enemies who are in a Power Burst and automatically counter their attacks.
Brute	A muscular thug who recognizes that his physique is his greatest asset; he uses heavy weapons.	Brutality	Each point of damage you take has a low chance of letting you enter a Power Burst.
Dervish	A deadly dancer in battle who sprints between skirmishes with an unpredictable weapon.	Whirling Death	You are always in a Power Burst, but take double damage and suffer crits twice as often.
Duelist	A nimble noble who is courteous to a fault, unless dishonored… then a duel is called for.	Elegance	The first time each enemy damages you, your next attack has a chance to be a Power Strike if made against that enemy.
Guardian	A cautious defender who prefers to use polearms and shields to keep foes at bay.	Foresight	You preemptive-counter all enemy Power Strikes when the attacker is in your attack range.
Hunter	A tireless tracker who stalks prey through the wild before striking with a so-called "primitive" weapon.	Naturalism	On even-numbered rounds, you can move twice (or take your normal action).
Jester	A cackling comedian who gauges his foes at a distance before hurling an arsenal of thrown weapons.	Hurling	On odd-numbered rounds, you have a low chance to enter a Power Burst; attacks you make raise Zone Tension faster.
Marksman	A quiet, calm sniper who is skilled with all forms of projectile weaponry, and uses it to great effect.	Marksmanship	You have a moderate chance for any attack you make to be a Power Strike; this chance falls as Zone Tension rises.
Swordsman	A humble warrior who seeks a balanced approach to mastering the blade.	Swordplay	As Zone Tension rises, your accuracy improves and you gain an increased chance to counter any attack.
			
			
			
			A Power Burst is a brief period where a character gets an extra action each turn and deals more damage; various class abilities grant them.
			A Power Strike is a single attack with doubled accuracy, damage, crit, and influence; like a Power Burst, a class can grant them.
			Each area has a Zone Tension score that rises with each attack an NPC makes; various abilities rely on this.
